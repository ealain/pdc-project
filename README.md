# Repository for the COM-302 project at EPFL

## Goal

Transmit a text of roughly 160 characters between two laptops in less than 3 minutes and without errors. The display of the first laptop is used as the transmitting device while the camera of the second laptop is used as the receiving device.

To spice up the project, a random mask will be put on top of the screen of the transmitter. It will cover half of the area of the screen.
